<p>This sample shows a technique for composing LINQ statements on the fly,
dynamically, at run time. Please see the <strong>
<a href="Dynamic%20Expressions.html">Dynamic Expressions.html</a>
</strong> file in the current directory.</p>
    <p>
        See the <a href="../Connectivity.html">Connectivity</a> note found in the root directory
        for the samples project if you are have trouble running the database samples.</p>
    <p>
        Many of the LINQ samples require XML files and/or the version of the <strong>
Northwind</strong> sample database that is located in the <strong>Data</strong> directory. By default
the <strong>Data</strong> directory appears under the same parent folder as the other LINQ 
samples; therefore the path for the XML files and database file should be 
resolved automatically. Many of the sample files also require the <strong>
ObjectDumper</strong>
    project.</p>
