When you add an Entity/Typed View/Procedure, the custom properties read from the database are put into the custom properties tab.

However, if you change those custom properties (change values or add additional custom properties) those changes will not be reflected.

That is where this plug-in helps.  Run this plug in against the entire project or individual elements and it will make any extended properties from the database reflected in your LLBLGen code.

There are only two options:

1)  Ignore Microsoft Designer properties.  Microsoft uses properties to store all kinds of 'sql design tool' information.  This is something you do NOT generally want coming over to your project.  The one exception is one called MS_Description, which contains the description you put for fields into the SQL Gui designer.   If you turn this checkbox on, it will ignore all MS_** properties, except for MS_Description.

2)  Typed Lists are made up of existing fields from existing entities.  If you want the database extended properties from the fields used in your typed list to be custom properties in the typed list, turn this on.  This has the effect of providing documentation (assuming you are using description of fields in database) in the hints in VS even when using Typed Lists.
